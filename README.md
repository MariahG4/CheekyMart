Welcome to our repository! We are designing a new web application called CheekyMart, a new and innovative way of grocery shopping. Cheeky Mart is a grocery shopping app designed to provide a more efficient and user-friendly experience. The app allows users to browse products by category, view detailed product information, and manage their shopping carts with ease. The checkout process is designed to be straightforward, ensuring that users can complete their purchases without unnecessary delays through express pickup. The app may include features such as secure user authentication, grocery store wait time tracking, and order history tracking. The app will be built using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end design, Python and Flask for the back-end functionality, and MongoDB for data storage. These elements provide a complete solution aimed at improving the grocery shopping experience for customers.

The user will first be asked to sign in or register, where they can reset their password if they forget. Once they log in, they will be directed to the home page where they will find information about the application and the founders (us) and will have access to the menu bar, that is on every page, where they can browse products, search for products, view/edit their account information, and go to their shopping cart. When a user clicks on an item, they will be directed to the item detail page which will display a desrciption and other photos of the item, along with the option for the user to add the item to their cart. Once they are all finished shopping, they will go to the cart page to view the items, see if they want to make any last minute changes, and check out. Once a user clicks the checkout button, they will be redirected to the checkout page where they will be given the total amount for their purchase and a breakdown of the transaction, as well as forms they can fill out such as first name, last name, email, phone number, and payment information. If everything looks good, the user will click the place order button where the system will check if the payment information is valid, and if so, the transaction will be complete.
