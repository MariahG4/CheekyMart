Welcome to our repository! We are designing a new web application called CheekyMart, a new and innovative way of grocery shopping. Cheeky Mart is a grocery shopping app designed to provide a more efficient and user-friendly experience. The app allows users to browse products by category, view detailed product information, and manage their shopping carts with ease. The checkout process is designed to be straightforward, ensuring that users can complete their purchases without unnecessary delays through express pickup. The app may include features such as secure user authentication, grocery store wait time tracking, and order history tracking. The app will be built using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end design, Python and Flask for the back-end functionality, and MongoDB for data storage. These elements provide a complete solution aimed at improving the grocery shopping experience for customers.
